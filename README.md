# Welcome

Welcome to this half-day workshop on logging and testing with bots. In this workshop, we will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency with the Azure Bot Service. These labs assume a introductory to intermediate knowledge of this service, and if this is not the case, then you should spend the time working through the pre-requisites.

## Goals

- Effectively log chat conversations in your bot
- Perform rapid development/testing with Ngrok and test your bots with unit tests and direct bot communication

## Pre-requisites

This workshop is meant for an AI Developer on Azure. Since this is only a short workshop, there are certain things you need before you arrive.

Firstly, you should have some previous exposure to Visual Studio. We will be using it for everything we are building in the workshop, so you should be familiar with [how to use it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-ide) to create applications. Additionally, this is not a class where we teach you how to code or develop applications. We assume you have some familiarity with C# (intermediate level - you can learn [here](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Lvld4EQIC_2706218949)). 

Secondly, you should have some experience developing bots with Microsoft's Bot Framework. We won't spend a lot of time discussing how to design them or how dialogs work. If you are not familiar with the Bot Framework, you should take [this Microsoft Virtual Academy course](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/creating-bots-in-the-microsoft-bot-framework-using-c-17590#!) prior to attending the workshop.

Thirdly, you should have experience with the portal and be able to create resources (and spend money) on Azure. We will not be providing Azure passes for this workshop.
